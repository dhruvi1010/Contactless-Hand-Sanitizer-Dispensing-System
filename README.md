# Contactless-Hand-Sanitizer-Dispensing-System

Introduction :
Sanitizing hands are a very important to stop spreading  COVID-19. As squeezing the container spout is unhygienic,it's a very necessary to deploy Auto Sanitizer which will help to sanitize hands without being touched with container spout.This is the best solution for industry, workplaces, hospitals and shopping centers etc. where lot of people meet together.
Conventional contactless sanitizer are made up of ldr and infra-red sensor. The key problem of that conventional sanitizer is their malfunctioning due to the sunlight, surrounding temperature, etc. It can be overcome by using an ultrasonic sensing device is very useful to dispense sanitizer in an automated contactless manner.
Contact-less Completely Programmed sanitizer has been proposed with an inbuilt Ultrasonic sensor (HC- SR04) that detects hands when put beneath the container and the sanitizer dispenses through the nozzle. Additionally this proposed unit provides the required amount of spillage for specific time duration and gets prepared for the next action rapidly within half second of duration.
